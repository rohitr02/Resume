\noindent \textbf{\underline{RELEVANT EXPERIENCE}} \\
\noindent \textbf{Stria Labs} \hfill San Mateo, California \\
\textit{Firmware Intern} \hfill July, 2020 $-$ Sept, 2020
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=*]
\item {Helped support Stria's goal to provide assistive technology for the blind via the Stria Band -- a wearable technology for mitigating veering -- and the Stria App -- a mobile application to be used with the Stria Band.}
\item {Developed firmware in C++ to establish communication between the hardware components of the Stria Band and the Stria App.}
\item {Contributed 3 key features within the firmware.}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep, nolistsep, leftmargin=*]
\item {Reading and processing raw data from the hardware components and sending it to the mobile application.}
\item {Allowing commands entered on the app to control firmware code execution and enable/disable specific hardware components.}
\item {Allowing commands sent from the hardware -- in the form of varying button presses -- to trigger actions on the mobile app.}
\end{itemize}
\item {Collaborated with the mobile development interns to ensure that both the application and hardware components were able to read/write data seamlessly.\\}
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Chinmaya Vrindavan Temple} \hfill Cranbury, NJ \\
\textit{Mobile App Developer} \hfill June, 2018 $-$ August, 2018
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=*]
\item {Developed an interactive application to engage and nurture cultural interest in students outside of the temple's religious classes.}
\item {Contributed 4 culturally themed minigames in C\# using Unity3D -- an endless runner game, a card matching game, a flashcards game, and a gravity runner game.}
\item {Improved lag nearly 75\% by implementing a feature to download only the necessary media and store it locally -- refreshing it only once when a minigame is opened.}
\item {Collaborated with a teammate to utilize media from a server so that the media could be changed without changing the application. }
\item {Collaborated with a UI designing teammate to integrate all 4 minigames into the larger application.}\\
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Artificially Intelligent Bots for a few minigames -- Python}\hfill  April, 2020 $-$ June, 2020
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=*]
\item {Developed several minigames including Flappy Bird, Snake, and an Endless Runner game in Python.}
\item {Created A.I. bots for each game that "evolved" and "learned" to play a game better over time.}
\item {Utilized the following libraries: Pygame, Neuro-Evolution of Augementing Technologies (NEAT), Numpy, Matplotlib, Pickle.}\\
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Genesis Calculator -- Swift} \hfill  July, 2019 $-$ August, 2019
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=*]
\item {Developed an iOS application to calculate the minimum grades needed on future tests based on previous grades.}
